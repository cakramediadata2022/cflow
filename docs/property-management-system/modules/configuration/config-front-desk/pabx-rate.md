# PABX Rate

PABX Rate is used to manage the rates for telephone calls made through the hotel's PABX (Private Automatic Branch Exchange) system. This configuration allows the hotel to define call rates for different destinations, such as local, national, or international calls, ensuring accurate billing and cost control for guest and internal calls.

Managing PABX rates helps the hotel maintain transparent and consistent telephone charges, supporting both guest services and internal operations.
