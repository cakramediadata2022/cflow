# User Setting

User Setting is a feature used to manage users and user groups. A user is an individual who is granted access to the Cakrasoft system, while a user group defines the access permissions for menus and modules within the system. Each person in Cakrasoft has a unique identification and belongs to a specific group, which restricts their access to certain modules.

User Setting is used to input data for all personnel who will operate the system, from staff to management.
