# Item Category

Item Category is used to manage inventory item categories. Cost and Expense accounts can be differentiated for each sub department. If a sub department does not have its own cost and expense accounts, it will use those defined in the Item Category.

## What is an Item Category?

An Item Category groups inventory items for accounting and reporting purposes. It allows you to set default accounts for inventory, cost of goods sold (COGS), expenses, sales, adjustments, and spoilage. You can also assign specific COGS and Expense accounts for different sub departments if needed.
