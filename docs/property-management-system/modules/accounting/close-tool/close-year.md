# Close Year

The Close Year feature is used to finalize the accounting period for the year. This process transfers all transaction balances from the current accounting period to the next period, ensuring a clean start for the new year.

## Description

Close Year is performed at the end of the fiscal year to close out all accounts and move balances forward. This helps maintain accurate records and prepares the system for the next year's transactions.
