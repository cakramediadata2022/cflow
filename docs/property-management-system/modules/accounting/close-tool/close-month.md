# Close Month

The Close Month feature is used to finalize monthly transactions. This menu should be used only after confirming that all transactions for the month have been entered. Closing the month prevents further data entry for that period unless authorized. If a user attempts to enter transactions in a closed month, the system will require authorization to save the data.

Canceling the close month process allows users to enter data without requiring authorization for that month.

## Step-by-Step Process for Close Month

1. Select the **Accounting** menu, then choose the **Close Month** submenu to open the Close Month Editor window.
2. The editor displays 12 group boxes, each representing a month. Each month can have one of three statuses:
   - **No Transaction**: No transactions for the month; button is not displayed.
   - **Closed at [date]**: Transactions exist and the month has been closed; button is labeled **Cancel Close Month**.
   - **Still Open**: Transactions exist and the month is not closed; button is labeled **Close Month**.
3. Select the accounting year in **Year**.
4. To close a month, select a month with transactions and status **Still Open**, then click **Close Month**.
5. A confirmation window will appear. Click **Yes** to proceed or **No** to cancel.
6. If **Yes** is selected, the label for that month changes to **Cancel Close Month**.

## Cancel Close Month Process

1. Select the **Accounting** menu, then choose the **Close Month** submenu to open the Close Month Editor window.
2. Select the reporting year in **Year**.
3. Select a month that has been closed (label **Cancel Close Month**), then click **Cancel Close Month**.
4. A confirmation window will appear. Click **Yes** to proceed or **No** to cancel.
5. If **Yes** is selected, the label changes back to **Close Month** and the status becomes **Still Open**.
