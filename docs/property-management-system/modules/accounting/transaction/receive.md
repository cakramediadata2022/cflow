# Receive

The Receive feature is used to process incoming transactions or cash receipts for the hotel or company. These receipts typically come from company or hotel income sources. For hotels, this feature is mainly used for non-operational receipts; operational income is processed through the Cakrasoft Hotel System via journal export. Receipts processed here do not create receivables and are received directly as cash or non-cash funds.
