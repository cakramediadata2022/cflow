# Income Budget

The Income Budget feature is used to estimate and plan the hotel's revenue for each accounting period. It allows users to set budget targets for different sub departments and accounts, using various input methods to match the hotel's planning needs.

## Step-by-Step Process to Create an Income Budget

1. Select the **Accounting** menu, then click the **Income Budget** submenu to open the Income Budget window.
2. Click the **Insert** button to add new budget data.
3. Enter the accounting period in **Period**.
4. Enter the sub department in **Sub Department**.
5. Enter the account code in **Account**.
6. Choose the input type:
   - **Manual**: Enter monthly budget amounts for each month (January to December). The total will be calculated automatically.
   - **Average**: Enter the total budget in **Amount**. The system will divide the total evenly across all months.
   - **Percentage**: Enter the total budget and specify the percentage for each month until the total reaches 100%.
   - **Daily**: Enter the total budget in **Amount**. The system will divide the budget for each month based on the number of days in that month.
7. Click **Save** to store the budget, or **Close** to cancel.
8. Repeat the process for each planned revenue source in the hotel.
