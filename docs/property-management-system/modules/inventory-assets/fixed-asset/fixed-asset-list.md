# Fixed Asset List

The Fixed Asset List feature is used to view and administer the company's fixed assets. It is also used for configuring depreciation, asset location, and asset status. Depreciation configuration can be performed per item or per group of items purchased together in a single invoice. When the FA Receive process is completed, the system will automatically create inventory records for each item received.

In addition to adding fixed asset items through the FA Receive process, assets can also be added directly in the Fixed Asset List. This process does not affect financials or the balance sheet. To align the asset list with the balance sheet, a journal process should be performed.
