# Stock Opname

Stock Opname is performed to match and correct inventory between physical stock and the records in the system when discrepancies occur. Stock opname can be done weekly or monthly. If the system's recorded stock is higher than the physical count, it results in a cost or expense. If the system's stock is lower, it results in a cost reduction. All discrepancies must be validated and checked for accuracy. Spoil, cost, and expense processes should be handled separately and not at the same time.

## Step-by-Step Process for Stock Opname

1. Select the **Inventory & Assets** menu, then click the **Stock Opname** submenu to open the Stock Opname window.
2. Click the **Insert** button to start a new stock opname. The Stock Opname Editor window will appear.
3. Enter the opname date in **Date** to display the stock data to be checked.
4. Click **Load Stock Data** to display the inventory table.
5. Click **Clear** to clear the table if needed.
6. Select the sub department consuming the items in **Sub Dept**.
7. Enter the costing document number in **Document #**.
8. Check **Spoil** if the items are lost or damaged.
9. If not spoil, select whether the items are issued as **Journal as COGS** (cost of goods sold) or **Journal as Expense** (expense). (If spoil is checked, these options are disabled.)
10. Enter the actual physical count for each item in the **Total Store** column if there is a discrepancy between system and physical stock.
11. The **Difference** column will auto-fill. A negative value means the physical count is less than the system, resulting in a cost or expense. A positive value means the physical count is more, resulting in a cost reduction.
12. To finish the opname process, click **Process Stock Opname**.
13. Click **Close** to exit the Stock Opname Editor window.

Repeat the opname process as needed if there are differences in consumption per sub department when the physical stock is less than the system stock.
