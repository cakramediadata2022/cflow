# Auto Posting Transaction

Auto Posting Transaction is used to automatically post room charges, daily charges, tax, and service fees into guest folios. This process can be repeated as needed; once posted, transactions will not be posted again unless reposting is performed. The feature also allows reposting of previously autoposted transactions.

This option is typically used by the night auditor during the night audit process.

## How to Use Auto Posting Transaction

1. Select the **Night Audit** menu, then click the **Auto Posting Transaction** submenu to open the editor window.
2. Click the **Precheck Auto Post** button to display the list of transactions to be posted and those already posted.
3. Click the **Post** button to process the posting. The result will show the total amount posted in the **Amount Posted** column and the posting status in the **Result** column (e.g., "Posting Successful" or "Already Posted 1 time(s)").
4. To repost transactions, select the folios to repost by checking the **Reposting** checkbox, or enable **Reposting All Folio** to repost for all folios, then click **Post**.
5. If there are errors in the posted amounts, double-click the folio in the list to open the Folio Transaction window. Make the necessary corrections, then repeat the posting process.
6. Click **Close** to finish.

Auto Posting Transaction streamlines the posting of charges and fees, ensuring accurate and efficient folio management during night audit.
