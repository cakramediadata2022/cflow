# Housekeeping

Housekeeping is a feature used to monitor hotel rooms. Users with the housekeeping access group can monitor and change the status and condition of rooms through the housekeeping menu options.

## Room Status

Rooms can have one of five statuses:

- **Vacant/Ready**: Room is ready to be sold and checked in.
- **Vacant/Clean**: Room is empty and clean.
- **Vacant/Dirty**: Room is empty and dirty (occurs after guest moves or checks out; staff must clean).
- **Occupied/Clean**: Room is occupied and clean (after check-in or after cleaning).
- **Occupied/Dirty**: Room is occupied and dirty (after a night's stay; staff must clean).

Only rooms with status Vacant/Clean can be checked in. Reservations can only be made for rooms not reserved by others and not marked as Unavailable or Out of Order.

## Filtering Room List

Housekeeping staff can filter the room list to display rooms with specific statuses, such as only showing rooms marked Unavailable.
