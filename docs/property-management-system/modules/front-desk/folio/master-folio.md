# Master Folio

Master Folio is used to create a folio as the master bill for a group or event, allowing transactions to be consolidated into a single bill. Like other folios, the master bill can be used for Charge, Payment, and Transfer transactions.

## How to Create a Master Folio

- The process for creating a Master Folio is the same as Desk Folio. Refer to the Desk Folio documentation for step-by-step instructions.

## Master Folio Transactions

- You can process charges, payments, and transfers in the Master Folio, just as you would in other folios.

Master Folio supports efficient billing and financial management for groups and events.
