# Folio History

Folio History is used to store guest and transaction data from folios that have been checked out, including Guest Folio, Desk Folio, and Master Folio. This menu is used to search for historical transaction and guest information for those who have stayed at the hotel.

Guest History can also be used to correct transactions that have already been checked out if errors are found.

## How to Manage Folio History

- The process for managing transactions in Folio History is the same as in Guest Folio. Refer to the Guest Folio documentation for details on correcting and managing transactions.

Folio History supports accurate record-keeping and post-checkout transaction management for hotel operations.
