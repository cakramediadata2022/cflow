### 3.1.2 Deposit

Reservation deposit is a payment of a sum of money paid by guests to accommodation providers (such as hotels, villas, or apartments) as a guarantee or confirmation of room or accommodation booking on certain dates.

This deposit is usually required by accommodation providers as a security measure that shows the guest's serious intention to stay and to avoid sudden cancellations or no-shows (when guests don't show up without notice).

#### Key Points About Reservation Deposits:

**Purpose of Guarantee**: Reservation deposits are intended to secure bookings and provide guarantee that guests will come on the selected date. This helps accommodation providers reduce risk of revenue loss due to sudden cancellations.

**Deposit Amount**: The amount of deposit varies depending on accommodation provider policies. Some places may require deposit equal to full stay cost, while others may require certain percentage of total cost.

**Deposit Return**: Deposits can be returned to guests after they complete their stay and meet all established requirements, such as not damaging property or items inside. However, if there are cancellations or violations of rules, accommodation providers may retain part or all of the deposit.

**Payment Methods**: Deposit payments can be made various ways, such as bank transfer, credit card, or even cash. Payment methods are usually regulated by accommodation provider policies.

**Deposit Time Limit**: Accommodation providers often have certain time limits for deposit payment after booking is made. If deposit is not paid within specified time, booking may be cancelled.

**Cancellation Policy**: Reservation deposits are also related to cancellation policies. If guests cancel reservations according to existing policies, they may get deposit refund, but if they cancel outside time limit or there are cancellation fees, the deposit may be lost.

**Booking Confirmation**: After deposit is paid, guests usually receive booking confirmation that includes their booking details, including stay dates, room type, and deposit amount paid.

Reservation deposits are important part of accommodation booking process and function as tool to protect accommodation providers from potential losses due to cancellations or no-shows. This also gives guests confidence that they have accommodation they booked.

For deposits there are several payment types that can be used such as:
1. **Cash**
