# API Response Status Codes

All API responses from the Cakrahub Booking Engine follow a standard structure:

## Default Response Structure

```json
{
	"StatusCode": 0,
	"Message": "Success",
	"Result": { /* response data or null */ }
}
```

- **StatusCode**: Indicates the status of the API call. `0` means success; other values indicate errors.
- **Message**: Human-readable message describing the result of the API call. Could be used as Toast Message.
- **Result**: Contains the main result. This is an object with the response data, or `null` if there is no result.

Use these codes to interpret the result of any API call. For error handling, check the `StatusCode` and `Message` fields in the response.

## Error Handling

When an error occurs, the API will return an appropriate HTTP status code along with an error message in the response body.
