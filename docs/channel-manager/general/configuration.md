# Configuration

The **Configuration** menu is an additional menu where you can update availability and rates here using data from Excel.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<div style={{marginBottom: '1.5rem'}}>
<img
      src="/img/cm/configuration/config-list.png"
      alt="Config List"
      style={{
        borderRadius: "8px",
        marginTop: "1rem",
        boxShadow: "0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)",
      }}
    />
</div>

## How to Use

1. Click import Excel `ARI`.
2. When the `select` file form appears, you can choose the Excel file that you have filled in before. For the Excel format, you can download the Excel file from the _`download import form`_ text.
3. After the file has been successfully selected, you can directly click upload, then the `ARI` data (rate and availability) will be automatically updated in the inventory menu.

:::tip Best Practice
It is recommended to use this feature when you more often use Excel to record `ARI`. It would be better to still update `ARI` through the inventory menu, but if connected to PMS, it is better to update `ARI` only in the PMS
