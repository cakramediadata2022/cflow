# Bookings

The **Bookings** menu is used to display and filter the list of reservations (bookings) received from various OTAs (Online Travel Agents) into the PMS system. This menu does not provide features to create, edit, or delete bookings manually. All booking data displayed is the result of automatic synchronization from OTAs.

  />
</div>

## Main Bookings Functions

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: All latest bookings from OTAs directly appear on the dashboard.
- **Filter & Search**: Can filter booking lists based on date, status, OTA, or guest name.
- **View Details**: Can view complete details of guest data, rooms, and booking status received from OTAs.
- **Resolve Mapping**: If there are bookings received but room type or rate is not yet mapped, this menu provides a resolve feature to connect booking data to the correct room type and rate in the system.
