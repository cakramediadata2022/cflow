# Manage User

The **Manage User** menu is the center for managing all users that can be configured in the integration system. Here you can create, edit, and delete users, as well as set access rights and user details according to operational needs. All user data inputted will be used for management processes and access right configuration so integration runs smoothly and consistently.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<div style={{marginBottom: '1.5rem'}}>
<img

        marginTop: "1rem",
        boxShadow: "0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)",
      }}
