# Log ARI

The **Log ARI** menu is used to monitor the status of ARI (Availability, Rate, Inventory) data transmission from PMS to Channel Manager. With this menu, you can see whether ARI data was successful or failed, making the integration monitoring process more transparent and easy to monitor.

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<div style={{marginBottom: '1.5rem'}}>
<img

        marginTop: "1rem",
        boxShadow: "0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)",
